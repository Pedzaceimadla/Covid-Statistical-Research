    <h1>The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a major impact across the world.
        This survey is aimed to find out how many people are still getting the infection
        and how many have had the infection. This remains important as more people
        got vaccinated against COVID-19 with “boosters” and more people got COVID-19.</h1>
